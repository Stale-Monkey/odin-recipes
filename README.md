 A basic recipe website

 Created a homepage and directories called recipes and images to store recipe webpages and images to be embedded on those webpages. 
 The structure of the homepage contains the boiler-plate, A h1 heading and links to the recipe webpages which were contained in an unordered list.
 The recipe webpages contains the boiler-plate, different headings(h1 to h4), a description within a paragraph, ingredients contained within an unordered list and steps contained within an ordered list. 
 Also provied links to give credit to the websites the recipes were borrowed from.
